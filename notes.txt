X = note / step pad



MODE DESCRIPTION
====================================

C1 = Keyboard mode
    tap while not activated changes to this mode
    
    every subsequent tap on this button ( while selected ) cycles global key between 8 keys ( keyboard changes look to show current key )
    
    the pads are 5 octaves of 12 notes ( 4 left over )

    [ t1 - t8 select chord presets ]

C2 = Arppegio mode
    tap while not activated changes to this mode
    
    every subsequent tap on this button ( while selected ) cycles global key between 8 keys ( keyboard changes look to show current key )
    
    the first 3 rows of note pads are a 2 octave x 12 note Keyboard
    [ t1 move keyboard left, t2 move keyboard right, t3 resets ]

    the fourth row is for disabling / enabling steps in the arppegio
    [ t4 enable / disable all ] ( if they're all off, arppegiator is disabled )

    the fifth row cycles between arppegio modes ( up, down, repeat, etc )
    [ t5 selects random ]

    the sixth row row is a speed selection ( whole, half, quater, qater triplet, eigth, eigth triple, 16th, 16th triplet )
    [ t6 selects random ]

    the seventh row is the length of the notes ( whole, half, quater, qater triplet, eigth, eigth triple, 16th, 16th triplet )
    [ t7 selects random ]

    the eigth row is the number of octaves to move around
    [ t8 selects random ]

C3 = Chord mode
    tap while not activated changes to this mode
    
    every subsequent tap on this button ( while selected ) cycles global key between 8 keys ( keyboard changes look to show current key )

    the first 3 rows of note pads are a 4 octave x 12 note Keyboard
    [ t1 move keyboard left, t2 move keyboard right, t3 resets, ]

    the next 3 rows of note pads are a for chosing the chord note positions around your base note ( in the center )
    ( so you could say, go down 3 notes, and up 5 notes. all according to the key, and the root note )
    [ t4 ?, t5 ?, t6 ? ]

    the seventh row is the arppegio preset. you can select these from the track keys in keybaord mode
    [ t7 selects random ]

    the eigth row is a random offset for when the subsequent chord keys are 'pressed' for simulating realism. The higher the value, the wider the random.
    [ t8 makes the offset uniform instead of random, like a single step arppegio or 'harp' ]


C4 = Sequencer mode
    tap while not activated changes to this mode
    
    every subsequent tap on this button ( while selected ) starts / stops the sequencer

    the first 7 rows of note pads are 8 step sequences. tap to enable / disable
    [ t1 + row pad, set step length ( whole, half, quater, qater triplet, eigth, eigth triple, 16th, 16th triplet ),
      t2 + row pad, set note length ( whole, half, quater, qater triplet, eigth, eigth triple, 16th, 16th triplet ), 
      t3 + select a row to cut it,  
      t4 + select a row to paste what you copied,
      t5 + row pad set row restart / 50% restart / clear restart,
      t6 + row pad set row bounce / 50% bounce / clear bounce,
      t7 ? ]

    the eigth row is the current group of 8 steps. the sequencer will automatically restart when there are no steps past a group on any track
    [ t8 disabled auto restart so all tracks will always have 64 steps ]

C5 = some kind of CC mode ??
    ???

C6 = Patch bank / preset mode
    tap while not activated changes to this mode
    
    every subsequent tap on this button ( while selected ) selects the next preset

    all Tx pads are banks, all pads are presets

C7 = App Hotkey mode 
    tap while not activated changes to this mode

    the first row ?
    [ t1 ? ]

    the second row ?
    [ t2 ? ]

    the third row ?
    [ t3 ? ]

    the fourth row ?
    [ t4 ? ]

    the fifth row ?
    [ t5 ? ]

    the sixth row ?
    [ t6 ? ]

    the seventh row ?
    [ t7 ? ]

    the eigth row ?
    [ t8 ? ]

C8 = System and settings mode
    tap while not activated changes to this mode

    the first 2 rows are channel selection 1 - 16 ( select as many as you like. )
    [ t1 = omni ( select all ), t2 activate channel bounce ( every note will cycle between selected channels ) ]

    the third row selects the bpm. pad 1 and 2 are + / - 1, pads 4 and 5 are + / - 10, pad 7 lets you tap in a bpm
    [ t3 blinks at the current bpm ]

    the fourth and fifth are bank / preset saving and loading. press once to select and load, press a loaded preset to save over it.
    [ t4 to confirm load / save, t5 to save current preset over another one ]

    the sixth row ?
    [ t6 ? ]

    the seventh row changes between 8 different apps on the raspberry pi
    [ t7 confirm ]

    the eigth row, first button is restart. last button is shutdown.
    [ t8 confirm ]
